# Top 10 List of Week 03

1. [Ext 4 Linux Partition](https://opensource.com/article/18/4/ext4-filesystem)<br>
In this article, they introduce me about various linux filesystem time after time. I learn about ext, ext2, ext3, and finally ext4 that now mostly linux distro use for. It is interesting that linux use different filesystem from windows and in dual boot, linux can read windows partition but windows cant read linux's.

2. [NTFS vs EXT4](https://www.geekboots.com/story/ntfs-vs-ext4-vs-fat32)<br>
This article explain about the differences between windows filesystem(ntfs) and linux(ext4). Because I use dual boot on my laptop, I am curious about the differences between them. It turns out that ext4 is better file-system because it has better divides and organizes file in blocks of Disk. Linux can read NTFS because it has opensource NTFS-3G to read ntfs while windows need 3rd party app to read ext4 partition.

3. [Boot Ubuntu on Network](https://linuxhint.com/pxe_boot_ubuntu_server/)<br>
In this article, it shows me how to boot ubuntu on network filesystem using PXE (Preboot Execution Environment). PXE is a protocol used to boot operating systems over the network. You can use this method to install your favorite Linux distribution on your laptop, desktop or server via PXE over the network.

4. [Inode in linux](https://linoxide.com/linux-inode/)<br>
In linux, there are inodes to store metadata and permission of that file/folder. Inode contains a list of all the blocks in which a file is stored, the owner information for that file, permissions and all other attributes that are set for the file. Inode limits is per filesystem and is decided at filesystem creation time. The maximum directory size dependent on the filesystem and thus the exact limit differs.

5. [BBFS and FUSE](https://www.cs.nmsu.edu/~pfeiffer/fuse-tutorial/html/running.html)<br>
This page of the tutorial explains how to build the BBFS filesystem program and use it to mount a directory. When I follow this Week 3, I was curious how the bbfs actually work. In this page explain much and how to prevent unwanted things to your computer.

6. [Why snap mounted as partition](https://askubuntu.com/questions/1047456/why-are-all-snaps-being-mounted-and-listed-as-block-devices-or-partitions-for-ub)<br>
In this forum, they discuss about snap package that mounted itself as partition on /dev/loop. It turns out that snap still kept the old version of a package if you update to the newest. They also show us how to remove old package version on snap partition.

7. [Pointer in C](https://www.guru99.com/c-pointers.html)<br>
In C, there is no garbage collector. We can use efficient memory if we use pointer. We save the address of a data instead of the value of the data, therefore we can use this data accross function and void. This pointer thing is a bit strange in java and python.

8. [Advantage of Tarball](https://superuser.com/questions/565883/what-is-the-advantage-of-using-tar-today)<br>
When I use windows, I see that .tar file that uncommonly use in windows. So I decided to learn about tar file. It turns out that .tar file in linux is have better performance of compression. Tarball also has more feature and compability.

9. [TOP 15 Compression Method](https://www.unixmen.com/top-15-file-compression-utilities-linux/)<br>
In this article, they explain about various compression method in linux. Apparently, there are much more how to compress file and different kind of compression in linux. It is very interesting.

10. [Compression Crash Course](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lto-ajuqW3w)<br>
This is a video by Numberphile channel on Youtube that discuss about compression method. It is entertaining that compression goals is to reduce file size and not losing its content. This makes me realize that compression is very helpful.
