# Top 10 List of Week 08

1. [Asymmetric vs. Symmetric Multiprocessing](https://techdifferences.com/difference-between-symmetric-and-asymmetric-multiprocessing.html)<br>
There are two types of multiprocessing, Symmetric Multiprocessing and Asymmetric Multiprocessing. Multiprocessing system has more than one processor and they can execute multiple process simultaneously. In Symmetric Multiprocessing, processors shares the same memory. In Asymmetric Multiprocessing there is a one master processor that controls the data structure of the system.

2. [Preemptive Scheduling](https://www.guru99.com/preemptive-vs-non-preemptive-scheduling.html)<br>
Preemptive Scheduling is a scheduling method where the tasks are mostly assigned with their priorities. Sometimes it is important to run a task with a higher priority before another lower priority task, even if the lower priority task is still running. At that time, the lower priority task holds for some time and resumes when the higher priority task finishes its execution.

3. [Non-Preemptive Scheduling](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/preemptive-and-non-preemptive-scheduling/)<br>
Non-preemptive Scheduling is used when a process terminates, or a process switches from running to waiting state. In this scheduling, once the resources (CPU cycles) is allocated to a process, the process holds the CPU till it gets terminated or it reaches a waiting state. In case of non-preemptive scheduling does not interrupt a process running CPU in middle of the execution. Instead, it waits till the process complete its CPU burst time and then it can allocate the CPU to another process.

4. [Load Balancing](https://avinetworks.com/what-is-load-balancing/)<br>
Load balancers manage the flow of information between the server and an endpoint device (PC, laptop, tablet or smartphone). The server could be on-premises, in a data center or the public cloud. The server can also be physical or virtualized. The load balancer helps servers move data efficiently, optimizes the use of application delivery resources and prevents server overloads. Load balancers conduct continuous health checks on servers to ensure they can handle requests. If necessary, the load balancer removes unhealthy servers from the pool until they are restored. Some load balancers even trigger the creation of new virtualized application servers to cope with increased demand.

5. [Classical Synchronization Problems](https://www.studytonight.com/operating-system/classical-synchronization-problems)<br>
In this tutorial we will discuss about various classical problem of synchronization. Semaphore can be used in other synchronization problems besides Mutual Exclusion. Below are some of the classical problem depicting flaws of process synchronaization in systems where cooperating processes are present. We will discuss the following three problems: Bounded Buffer (Producer-Consumer) Problem Dining Philosophers Problem The Readers Writers Problem

6. [FCFS Scheduling Algorithm](https://www.guru99.com/fcfs-scheduling.html)<br>
First Come First Serve (FCFS) is an operating system scheduling algorithm that automatically executes queued requests and processes in order of their arrival. It is the easiest and simplest CPU scheduling algorithm. In this type of algorithm, processes which requests the CPU first get the CPU allocation first. This is managed with a FIFO queue. The full form of FCFS is First Come First Serve.

7. [Priority Scheduling Algorithm](https://www.guru99.com/priority-scheduling-program.html)<br>
Priority Scheduling is a method of scheduling processes that is based on priority. In this algorithm, the scheduler selects the tasks to work as per the priority. The processes with higher priority should be carried out first, whereas jobs with equal priorities are carried out on a round-robin or FCFS basis. Priority depends upon memory requirements, time requirements, etc.

8. [Round Robin Scheduling Algorithm](https://www.guru99.com/round-robin-scheduling-example.html)<br>
The name of this algorithm comes from the round-robin principle, where each person gets an equal share of something in turns. It is the oldest, simplest scheduling algorithm, which is mostly used for multitasking. In Round-robin scheduling, each ready task runs turn by turn only in a cyclic queue for a limited time slice. This algorithm also offers starvation free execution of processes.

9. [Shortest Job First Algorithm](https://www.guru99.com/shortest-job-first-sjf-scheduling.html)<br>
Shortest Job First (SJF) is an algorithm in which the process having the smallest execution time is chosen for the next execution. This scheduling method can be preemptive or non-preemptive. It significantly reduces the average waiting time for other processes awaiting execution. The full form of SJF is Shortest Job First.

10. [Comparison Scheduling Algorithm](https://unacademy.com/lesson/comparison-of-scheduling-algorithms/BYKW5NJZ)<br>
After I learn scheduling algorithm in number 6-9. I am curious to find out how is it going and compare it to each others. This video compares all the scheduling algorithms and offers figures, examples, and a clear explanation about each one. It also presents the advantages and disadvantages of each scheduling algorithm. It's a great way to end this week's GSGS journey.
