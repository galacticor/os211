# Top 10 List of Week 05

1. [Linux Top Command](https://www.tecmint.com/12-top-command-examples-in-linux/)<br>
This article provides the command guid and examples in linux. Top command is needed in this weeks todo list. So, I look for another examples and guides for this command. It can see specific system process and very useful to watch that specific system process.

2. [Logical and Physical Address](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/logical-and-physical-address-in-operating-system/)<br>
This article shows us the differences between logical and physical address in operating system. The basic difference between Logical and physical address is that Logical address is generated by CPU in perspective of a program whereas the physical address is a location that exists in the memory unit. The logical address does not exist physically in the memory whereas physical address is a location in the memory that can be accessed physically.

3. [What is Paging in OS](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/paging-in-operating-system/)<br>
This artile explaines us about paging in operating system. This article also show the diagram that used by paging and very interesting. Paging is a memory management scheme that eliminates the need for contiguous allocation of physical memory. This scheme permits the physical address space of a process to be non â€“ contiguous.

4. [Paging Performance](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/performance-of-paging/)<br>
This performance cover the performance of paging and the expression for evaluating paging performance. Performance of paging and swap file is a bit different but still improve the system performance. In this artilce also shows the diagram of the paging file.

5. [Page Replacement Algorithm](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/page-replacement-algorithms-in-operating-systems/)<br>
In an operating system that uses paging for memory management, a page replacement algorithm is needed to decide which page needs to be replaced when new page comes in. This article shows us several page replacement algorithm. Each algorithm has its own benefit.

6. [Memory Allocation API in Linux](https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/core-api/memory-allocation.html)<br>
This is documentation of linux api for memory allocation. It is very interesting that we can write our own program in C to allocate memory in linux. Linux provides a variety of APIs for memory allocation.

7. [Local vs Global Allocation Policies](https://codescracker.com/operating-system/local-versus-global-allocation-policies.htm)<br>
There are two different allocation polices. This page shows us the differences between allocation polices. This article also shows us the ilustration of the step by step. 

8. [Memory Allocation Examples in Java](https://dzone.com/articles/native-memory-allocation-in-examples)<br>
After I read the documentation memory allocation API in C, I am curious about Java. This articles explain memory allocation in Java and its example. Turns out it is not bad for Java performances.

9. [Kernel Memory vs Task Manager](https://www.techwalla.com/articles/what-is-kernel-memory-in-task-manager)<br>
The kernel memory in the task manager is a part of the total memory available in a computer that is blocked off for the operating system's processes. The total memory consists of the RAM (random-access memory) and the virtual memory.

10. [Memory-mapped IO vs Port-mapped IO](https://www.bogotobogo.com/Embedded/memory_mapped_io_vs_port_mapped_isolated_io.php)<br>
Microprocessors normally use two methods to connect external devices: memory mapped or port mapped I/O. However, as far as the peripheral is concerned, both methods are really identical.
