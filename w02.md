# Top 10 List of Week 02

1. [How SHA256 Works](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mbekM2ErHfM)<br>
Video ini menjelaskan bagaimana token sha256 bekerja. Token sha256 merupakan token yang sangat baik untuk menjaga keamanan. Setiap sha256 enkripsi memiliki faktor yang unik dan sangat kecil kemungkinannya untuk bisa ada duplikasi.

2. [Birthday Attack](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/computer-science/birthday-attack)<br>
In this article explains about birthday attack that is a cryptographic attack based on birthday paradox. Birthday paradox is a foundation about security and cryptographic that show about duplicate identity of two entities. In probability theory, the birthday paradox or birthday problem considers the probability that some paired people in a set of n randomly chosen of them, will have the same birthday. The mathematics behind this problem led to a well-known cryptographic attack called the birthday attack, which uses this probabilistic model to reduce the complexity of cracking a hash function 

3. [MD5Hashing](https://md5hashing.net/)<br>
This web is all about hash and cyptoraphy. In this web you can hash given string and also decode that hashcode. Also there are forums that discuss about hashing and cryptography. You also can cyptographic chat with another using hash code.

4. [SHA256 Collision](https://crypto.stackexchange.com/questions/47809/why-havent-any-sha-256-collisions-been-found-yet)<br>
This is forum in crypto stackexchange that discuss about SHA256 collision. SHA256 collision is where 2 different entity have same hash code. This is what birthday attack or birthday paradox talked about. Based on verified answer, the collision or someone that could make collision have to crack it and reverse engineered the sha256 and it takes 3.6 x 10^13 years.

5. [SHA256 and Bitcoin](https://www.mycryptopedia.com/sha-256-related-bitcoin/)<br>
This article explain about bitcoin and its connectivity to sha256 hash. SHA-256 is a cryptographic hash function that takes an input of a random size and produces an output of a fixed size. Bitcoin use the powerfull of 'one-way' encryption of sha256.

6. [SHA in CSGOROLL](https://www.csgoroll.com/en/info/provably-fair)<br>
This is a famous csgo trading skin and gambling site. In this very page, they explain the provably fair of the randomness of a roll used in gambling game. They used sha512 rather than sha256 and the random is fair that is no pattern or something setup. The hash function used for secure the server that generates the random.

7. [AWS Server Hacked](https://techmonitor.ai/techonology/cloud/aws-servers-hacked-rootkit-in-the-cloud)<br>
In this article tells us about an event that aws server is hacked. AWS in the most famous and have most margin in the cloud market. The hacks use a rootkit to aws server vm and this malware can open port that is prohibited by security group. This is a remember to me who also use aws frequently nowadays to always be careful. Some port in linux system is vulnerable if someone can connect and enter without our knowing it.

9. [GCC Hacks](https://developer.ibm.com/tutorials/l-gcc-hacks/)<br>
This article tells us about gcc hacks in linux kernel. Mostly it talks about usage of some core of c function that can speedup c process like bit hacking and some builtin c for linux function. This c hacks is useful if we often use c in linux kernel.

10. [Mr. Robot Hacking Scene](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GyWeWicgqCc)<br>
This is most satisfying scene from Mr.Robot TV series. In this scene, the main character tried to hack FBI from inside a jail. This is just random and interesting scene in Mr. Robot Series.
