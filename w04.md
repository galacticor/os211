# Top 10 List of Week 04

1. [Hardware Protection](http://operatingsystempoly.blogspot.com/p/hardware-protection.html)<br>
In this blog, it explains about hardware protection. The operating system have to ensure that incorrect program cant cause other program run incorrectly. Usually, this is requirement in sharing system resources. There are several type of Hardware protection such as Memory Protection, CPU Protection, and I/O Protection.

2. [Address Binding and its Types](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/address-binding-and-its-types/)<br>
In this article, it covers explanation of address binding and its type. The Association of program instruction and data to the actual physical memory locations is called the Address Binding. There are several type, Compile-time Address Binding, Load time Address Binding, Execution time or dynamic Address Binding.

3. [Binding vs Linking](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/difference-between-loading-and-linking/)<br>
This article covers the differences between loading and linking. Loading is bringing the program from secondary memory to main memory is called Loading while linking means establishing the linking between all the modules or all the functions of the program in order to continue the program execution is called linking. There are to types of linking and loading, those are static and dynamic.

4. [Little vs Big Endian](https://www.section.io/engineering-education/what-is-little-endian-and-big-endian/)<br>
This article explains about endianness. The differences between them is just how they stored bytes values in memory. There are no advantages over others. This article alos give explanation in c code so we can ilustrate the implementation in operating system.

5. [Memory allocation](https://binaryterms.com/static-and-dynamic-memory-allocation.html)<br>
It explains to us what is memory allocation and types of how to do that. The operating system need memory when it runs out and it sometime takes virtual memory. There are 2 types, that is static and dynamic mem alloc. I think the advantages is static over others, because it makes faster runtime of programs.

6. [Memory Swapping](https://www.enterprisestorageforum.com/hardware/what-is-memory-swapping/)<br>
Memory swapping works by making use of virtual memory and storage space in an approach that provides additional resources when required. In short, this additional memory enables the computer to run faster and crunch data better. This memory swapping uses swap file or swap space as temporary virtual memory. This approach can have better performance

7. [Swapping vs Paging](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/1688962/whats-the-difference-between-operating-system-swap-and-page)<br>
Swapping and paging are orthogonal concepts. These two are different concept. Paging are running pages or frames in process to virtual memory while swapping means move the unused part in physical memory to virtual memory stored in swap file. These two process make room for main memory to execute more when there is out of space in main memory.

8. [Swap Partition vs Swap File Performance](https://serverfault.com/questions/25653/swap-partition-vs-file-for-performance)<br>
There are two types to store swap, in a file or in disk partition. Swap file and partition is not the same thing. The swap partition is has better performance for disk using HDD because it barely fragmented while in swap file it can be fragmented and not close from one block swap to another.

9. [Pointers in C](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/162941/why-use-pointers)<br>
This forum discuss about why in C use pointers. Using pointers in C gives us advantages in performance because we can just use same value in same address instead assign that value to another address. This turns out to give lower memory requirements.

10. [Pointers in ther modern languages](https://medium.com/developers-arena/why-pointers-lost-their-popularity-in-java-c-and-other-modern-languages-2ad6dba5c847)<br>
While pointers has better performance for C, C++, or Golang languages, but others dont have pointers. Java, javascript, C# dont have pointer because it can make OOP programming become unsecure. So the pointers is powerful but not in style of programming. But still C and Golang has much better performance than other languages.
